		<h2>What is An-Ni-Go?</h2>
		<p>An-Ni-Go is a remake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!" target="_blank">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a> card game that originally came from the <abbr title="Japanese Animation">anime</abbr>. The main difference between the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game and the An-Ni-Go! card game is that instead of using monsters like in the Yu-Gi-Oh! version to fight, the player now uses anime characters from several different animes to fight instead.</p>

		<h2>How to play</h2>
		<p>Playing An-Ni-Go! is very simple, the removal of defenses and trap- and magic cards has made this game easily understood by people of all ages.<br>
		1. You decide who plays first, you or the computer. If you decide to play first, you can add a card to the field first, but cannot attack. If you play second, then you can add a card to the field and attack the other players card if you want.<br>
		2. If you plan to destroy the other players card, your card must be really strong, it's attack should be higher than your opponents attack.<br>
		3. If you succeed in destroying one of his cards he losses <abbr title="Health Points">HP</abbr>, the amount he losses can be calculated like this: Your cards attack - His cards attack = damage taken. Remember, this also works the other way around, so you can also get damage when he decides to attack you.<br>
		4. If one of you don't have an card on the field when you are attacking each other, the one without a card on the field will take direct damage and will suffer all the attack power in damage...</p>
